\section{Preliminaries and Motivations}

This section provides some preliminaries on ReRAM technology and cross-point architecture. Then the limitations of cross-point architecture are demonstrated by a series of simple example, which motivates the work in this paper.

\subsection{Motivations}
As aforementioned, although the cross-point structure can provide the fabricate simplicity and area efficiency, it also incur lots of design challenges. Following cases show some examples to demonstrate the disadvantages of the cross-point structure, which motivates the work in this paper.
