\section{Analysis of Design Constraints}\label{sec:wr}
\subsection{Overview}
\subsection{Write Operation}
1. Only consider the one-side scheme
Consider 1/2 1/3 and floating?
Energy Issue? Define Energy Efficient Parameter?
Reliable Issue: Any possibility of write disturbance 




2. Present the voltage drop problem
Reliability Issue

3. Two Way Scheme
