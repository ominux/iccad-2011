\section{Analysis of Design Constraints - A Case Study}\label{sec:w_and_r}

In this section, we study the effect of various schemes on cross-point
size and reliability in detail by using our mathematical model. The
constraints on array size, energy consumption and area overhead are
analyzed in the worst cases scenario. The results of this study will be a
useful guide in designing a cross-point array.

\vspace{-10pt}
\subsection{Overview}
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:modeling}, i
In order to write or read a cross-point array, proper voltages should be
applied across the ReRAM cell. Although the goal of a read operation is
different from a write operations, both of them are realized by fully
biasing the selected wordlines/bitlines and floating (or half biasing)
unselected wordlines/bitlines. Thus, the coefficient matrix $A$ and the
constant vector $C$ are very similar for both. In addition, their energy
consumption and area overhead will also have a similar trend. Therefore,
in this section, we first study the write operation comprehensively. After
that, for read operation, we mainly focus on the read margin analysis
since it is unique to reads.

Table~\ref{table:parameter} shows the circuit parameters of our baseline
50nm design. The data is derived from the recently published studies on
ReRAM~\cite{?????,memristor:Cong}. We study reliability, energy
consumption, and area overheads for four different write schemes, and
discuss the sensitivities of these schemes to the data pattern of HRS and
LRS ReRAM cells and cell non-linearity.

\subsection{Write Operation}
To write a ReRAM cell, an external voltage is applied across the cell for
a certain duration. Intuitively, there are four possible schemes for the
write operation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item According to the location of a selected cell, activate one wordline and one bitline and leave all of other lines floating (FWFB shemes).
  \item Activate the selected wordline and bitline. Leave all the unselected wordlines floating and half bias the unselected bitlines (FWHB shemes).
  \item In contrast to the scheme 2), activate the selected wordline and bitline. Leave all the unselected bitlines floating and half bias the unselected wold lines (HWFB shemes).
  \item Activate the selected wordline and bitline. Then half bias all other wordlines and bitlines (HWHB shemes).
\end{enumerate}
However,the FWFB scheme has inherent problem that may result in severe
write disturbance~\cite{??}. Therefore, in the following discussion, we
only compare the results of FWHB, HWFB and HWHB schemes. For each of these
three schemes, we can either write several cells at one wordline at the
same time or only write one bit per access and distribute the write
operation to several arrays. In the following discussion, we start from
one bit per access write operation, then the results of one wordline per
access method are discussed.

%Since several potential read/write schemes can be used to program a memory array, it is difficult to identify the ideal scheme that meets the design constraints in terms of area, energy, and reliability.
%However, the FWFB scheme has inherent problem that may result in severe
%write disturbance. For example, for writing a ReRAM cell located at the
%cross point of the $i^{nd}$ wordline and the $j^{nd}$ bitline in a $M
%\times N$ matrix ($M>N$), the worst case voltage drop of unselected cells
%appears when all of the ReRAM cells at the selected bitline are in the
%HRS, while all of the other cells are in the LRS. In this case, the
%voltage drop across the selected cell almost has the same magnitude as the
%unselected cell at the same bitline, resulting the write disturbance to
%all of the unselected cells at the selected bitline. Actually, the worst
%case voltage drop of the unselected cell can be calculated as:
%\begin{equation}\label{worst_FWFB}
%V_{worst}=V_{select} \cdot [1-\frac{1}{M+(N-1)R_{off}/R_{on}}].
%\end{equation}
%Considering that the reported On-OFF resistance ratio of ReRAM cell is
%always $>50$
%~\cite{ReRAM_IEDM2010_Ho,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Chien,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Diode,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Evidence,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Sheu,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Otsuka},
%, the worst case voltage drop at the unselected cell is larger than $98\%$
%of the voltage at the selected cell, making it is impossible to build a
%reliable cross-point structure ReRAM with the FWFB scheme. Therefore, in
%the following discussion, we only compare the results of FWHB, HWFB and
%HWHB schemes. For each of these three schemes, we can either write several
%cells at one wordline at the same time or only write one bit per access
%and distribute the write operation to several arrays. In the following
%discussion, we start from one bit per access write operation, then the
%results of one wordline per access method are discussed.

%Since reliability, energy consumption, and area overheads for these
%schemes are different, we address these problems separately and finally
%combine all constraints to provide design guidelines for write operations.


\vspace{6pt} \emph{Reliable Write Operation.} \vspace{6pt}

Write reliability is a serious concern in cross-point arrays. In an ideal
condition, the resistance of wires and the sneak currents in unselected
cells are negligible. In such a scenario, all the write schemes discussed
above will make sure that the write voltage $V_W(W)-V_B(W)$ is fully
applied across the specified cell. However, in reality, both wire
resistance and sneak current are non-trivial. Hence, the operation of
cross-point array will vary based on the data pattern stored in ReRAM
cells. A write is considered reliable if it modifies the content of the
selected cells to the new value without disturbing other unselected cells.
%A reliable write operation can be defined as: switching the selected cells into required states without disturbing the states of unselected cells.
There are two potential problems with writes: \emph{write failure}, an
unsuccessful write on selected cell, and \emph{write disturbance}, an
undesirable write on unselected cell. It is necessary to ensure that a
write scheme guarantees reliable operation even in the worst case (w.r.t
the location of cells to written and the data pattern stored in the
cross-point array). Otherwise, after several unreliable write operations,
the data stored in the cross-point array will become unpredictable.

%We first use an example to show the problem with FWFB scheme, which may
%result in severe write disturbance. Figure~\ref{fig:FWFR} shows the
%voltage drop across each ReRAM cell of a $64 \times 64$ cross-point array.
%In this example, in order to write the cell at the cross point of the
%$32^{nd}$ wordline and the $32^{nd}$ bitline, the selected wordline and
%bitline are biased at 2V and 0V, respectively. All of the other wordlines
%and bitlines are left floating. The ReRAM cells at the selected bitline are
%in the HRS, while all of the other cells are in the LRS. It is clear that
%the voltage drop across the selected cell ($V_{32,32}$) almost has the
%same magnitude as the unselected cell at the same bitline, resulting the
%write disturbance to all of the unselected cells at the selected bitline.
%Actually, for a $M \times N$ matrix ($M>N$), the worst case voltage drop
%of the unselected cell can be calculated as:
%\begin{equation}\label{worst_FWFB}
%V_{worst}=V_{select} \cdot [1-\frac{1}{M+(N-1)R_{off}/R_{on}}].
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{figure}[!b]

%  \caption{Write disturbance for FWFB schemes. ( $V_{W32} = 2V$, $V_{B32} = 0V$. $R_{x,32}$ at HRS, others at LRS.) }\label{fig:FWFR}
%\end{figure}
%Considering that the reported On-OFF resistance ratio of
%ReRAM cell is always $>50$ ~\cite{ReRAM_IEDM2010_Ho,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Chien,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Diode,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Evidence,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Sheu,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Otsuka},
%, the worst case voltage drop at the unselected cell is larger than $98\%$ of the voltage at the selected cell, making it is impossible to build a reliable cross-point structure ReRAM with the FWFB scheme. Therefore, in the following discussion, we only compare the results of FWHB, HWFB and HWHB schemes. For each of these three schemes, we can either write the cells at one wordline at the same time or only write one bit per access and separate the write operation to several arrays. In the
%following discussion, we start from one bit per access write operation,
%then the results of one wordline per access method are discussed.


%as long all of unselected cells in the activated wordline (or all of unselected cells in the activated bitline) are at HRS and other cells are in LRS, the voltage drop at unselected cells are mainly applied at the HRS cells at the wordline (or bitline).
%The worse case scenario for FWFB write disturbance can be defined as: all of unselected cells in the activated wordline (or all of unselected cells in the activated bitline) are at HRS and other cells are in LRS. In this case, the voltage drop at unselected cells are mainly applied at the HRS cells at the wordline (or bitline).

Write failure typically results from the voltage drop at the interconnect
wires along the wordline and bitline. It has been shown
that~\cite{crossbar_TED_2010}, for one bit per access write operation, the
worst case voltage drop occurs when writing the cell at the cross point of
the $M^{nd}$ wordline and the $N^{nd}$ bitline with all of the cells in
the array are in LRS. In order to avoid the write failure and successfully
program the selected ReRAM cell, the driven voltage should be boosted to a
higher level, making sure that the voltage across the cell exceeds the
threshold voltage even at the worst case. Figure~\ref{fig:worst_v} shows
the lower bound of the driven voltage for different sizes of cross-point
array. The minimum wordline/bitline voltage increases from 2.01~V for a $8
\times 8$ array to 4.47~V for a $128 \times 128$ cross-point array. In
addition, for a memory capability, the cross-point array can be organized
with different number of wordlines and bitlines. For example, a 4K bits
cross-point array can be implemented either by a $64 \times 64$ array or
by a $32 \times 128$ array. In the latter case, the voltage drops along
the wordline will be much more serious than along the bitline.
Figure~\ref{fig:shape} examines the voltage requirement for different
array organizations with different write schemes. The result shows that
from a reliability point of view, a cross-point array with same numbers of
wordlines and bitlines is the best choice. Furthermore, we also notice
that when the array has the same number of wordlines and bitlines, FWFB,
HWFB and FWHB schemes have the same minimum driven voltage.

%Clearly, the magnitude of the voltage drop increases with the array size and the resistance of interconnect wires.

    \vspace{-15pt}
\end{figure}

However, boosting the driven voltage also introduces other potential
problems for the array. In particular, increasing the driven voltage also
increases the voltage applied at unselected cells. Therefore, a write
disturbance may occur when the voltage applied at an unselected cell
exceeds the threshold voltage for SET or RESET operation.
Figure~\ref{fig:half} shows the maximum voltage applied at unselected
cells with the minimum driven voltage, which is determined in
Figure~\ref{fig:worst_v}. Since the threshold voltage of the ReRAM cell is
2V, only array sizes with worst case unselected cell voltage less than 2V
are allowable. Otherwise, the array is unreliable because it can not avoid
write failure and write disturbance at the same time. Therefore,
Figure~\ref{fig:half} provides a hard constraint on array size, and all of
the following energy and area tradeoffs should be bounded by this
constraint.

\vspace{6pt} \emph{Energy Consumption of Write Operation.} \vspace{6pt}

%The energy consumption of a write operation for a cross-point array can be calculated as:
%\begin{equation}
%E_{write} = E_{select} + E_{unselect} + E_{halfselect} + E_{line},
%\end{equation}
%where the $E_{select}$ is the energy consumed to change the state of the
%selected cell, the $E_{unselect}$ and $E_{halfselect}$ are the undesired
%energy wasted at the half selected and unselected cells. The energy
%consumed by the interconnect lines are represented by $E_{line}$.
%Figure~\ref{fig:energy} shows the decomposed energy consumption for the
%cross-point array. Note that, the $E_{line}$ and $E_{halfselect}$ take a
%large amount of the total energy consumption. Also, this part of energy
%wasted during the write operation takes greater part of the total energy
%for larger array sizes. For example, the undesired energy consumption for
%writing a $128{\times}128$ array is more than 1000 times larger than the
%$8{\times}8$ array. We also notice that, since the impact of sneak paths
%for floating schemes (FWHB and HWFB) is more serious, the energy consumed
%at unselected cells for floating schemes is larger than the half-biased
%scheme. Due to this reason, the total energy consumptions for FWHB and
%HWFB schemes are at least 10\% larger than that of HWHB scheme.
The energy consumption of a write operation including: the energy consumed
to change the state of the selected cell (denoted as $E_{select}$), the
undesired energy wasted at the half selected cells ($E_{halfselect}$) and
unselected cells ($E_{unselect}$), as well as the energy consumed by the
interconnect lines ($E_{line}$). Figure~\ref{fig:energy} shows the
decomposed energy consumption for the cross-point array. Note that, the
$E_{line}$ and $E_{halfselect}$ take a large amount of the total energy
consumption. Also, this part of energy wasted during the write operation
takes greater part of the total energy for larger array sizes. For
example, the undesired energy consumption for writing a $128{\times}128$
array is more than 1000 times larger than the $8{\times}8$ array. We also
notice that, since the impact of sneak paths for floating schemes (FWHB
and HWFB) is more serious, the energy consumed at unselected cells for
floating schemes is larger than the half-biased scheme. Due to this
reason, the total energy consumptions for FWHB and HWFB schemes are at
least 10\% larger than that of HWHB scheme.

    \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}

\vspace{6pt} \emph{Area cost of Write Operation.} \vspace{6pt}

The write operation for a $M \times N$ array requires totaly $M+N$ voltage
drivers. Therefore, the average number of ReRAM cells per voltage driver
can be calculated as $mn/(m+n)$. Given the array capacity of $C_{array}$,
it is easy to find that the optimal array organization can be achieved
when $M=N=\sqrt{C_{array}}$ and the maximum number of cells per voltage
driver is: $\sqrt{C_{array}}/2$. However, the area overhead of a voltage
driver is also related to its current drive capability.
Figure~\ref{fig:drive_i}(a) shows the maximum write current with different
ReRAM array sizes. According to the current requirement, the area of the
voltage driver can be directly calculated, which will be shown in the
following discussion.

\end{figure}


\vspace{6pt} \emph{Discussion on Multi-Bits Write Operation.} \vspace{6pt}

So far, we have only discussed the write operation with one bit per
access. In this section, we consider the difference between one bit per
access and one wordline per access write operations. Firstly, writing a
wordline at a time will worsen the voltage drop along the wordline.
%Therefore, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reliable_region},
Therefore the simulation results show that the reliable size of the
cross-point array will be further reduced. The maximum array size reduces
from $116{\times}116$ to $100{\times}100$ for HWFB and HWFB schemes.
%For the energy consumption point of view, the one wordline write operation is more efficient.

%\begin{figure}%[!t]

%    \vspace{-10pt}
%\end{figure}

In order to fairly compare the energy consumption, we compare the energy-per-bit instead of the total energy. For example, in order to write a wordline with size of 128, the energy-per-bit can be calculated as:
$E_{ave}=E_{total}/128/2$. Figure~\ref{fig:multi_energy} shows the energy-per-bit of the multi-bit write operation. The energy shown in this figure is normalized to the same unit as Figure~\ref{fig:energy} for easier comparison. The results show that for large cross point array sizes, the multi-bit write operation is much more energy efficient. This is because the energy wasted at the unselected and half-selected cells are shared by multiple bits and the average energy for one each bit is therefore reduced. However, although the multi-bit write operation has the advantage of lower energy consumption, the maximum current requirement for each wordline also increases. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:drive_i}(b), the maximum driven current for each bitline is almost the same as when writing one bit, however the drive capability for each word line is almost doubled for multi-bit writing. Since the area of the voltage driver increases proportionally with its drive capability, the area overhead for multi-bit writing is about 50\% larger than for one bit writing.

\subsection{Read Operation}
In this section we applied the similar sensing scheme as
\cite{crossbar_TED_2010} and \cite{crossbar_NANO08_Flocke}. In order to
read cell $R_{i,j}$, the $i^{th}$ wordline is biased at $V_{READ}$ and all
of the other wordlines and bitlines are grounded. Then the state of the
selected cell is read out by measuring the voltage across $R_s$. The
energy consumption for read operation can be analyzed by the same way as
that of the write operation. Since the read voltage is much smaller than
write voltage, the read energy is expected at least one order smaller than
write operation. Additionally, since the read voltage/current is much
lower than the write, we believe that the voltage drivers can always
provide enough current for the read operation if they meet the current
requirement for write operation. Therefore, we can conclude that the area
overhead of voltage drivers is determined by the write current. However,
the reliability of read operation is different from the write operation.
The read reliability is determined by the voltage swing for reading HRS
and LRS cells. Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin} (a) shows the voltage swing
with different array sizes and $K_r$ values. Large array sizes and large
non-linearity are harmful to the voltage swing: on the one hand, a larger
array has more sneak paths, making the output voltage very sensitive to
the data pattern of unselected cells; on the other hand, the non-linearity
increases the resistance of LRS and therefore the resistance difference
between HRS and LRS cells is reduced. In order to improve the reliability
of the read operation, a two-step sensing scheme can be applied, which
senses the current of an unselected cell first, then the overall current
is sensed, and after that the current difference is converted to the
output voltage. The voltage swing of this two-step sensing scheme is shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin} (b). By using this two-step sensing
schemes, the voltage swing for a given array size and non-linearity
coefficient is doubled.
