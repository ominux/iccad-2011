ReRAM is a promising candidate for next-generation non-volatile memory technology. The area efficient cross-point structure is the most attractive memory organization for ReRAM memory design. However, problems inherent in the cross-point structure, such as the existence of sneak current and voltage drops along the nanowires introduce challenges to the design of reliable ReRAM cross-point array. In this paper, we first establish a mathematical model for cross-point arrays. We show that the proposed model has a simple structure and is flexible to evaluate different write/read schemes. By using this model, we study in detail how reliability affects the array organization, size, energy consumption, and area overheads in designing cross-point arrays. Based on the results of our study, a detailed design methodology is proposed to help designers identify the optimal organization that meets the design constraints early in the design stage.
