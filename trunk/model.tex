\section{Modeling of the Cross-Point Memory}\label{sec:model}
In this section, a detailed mathematical model of cross-point memory array is built.
In this section, a detailed mathematical model of cross-point memory array
is built. By using the proposed model with specific parameters and
boundary conditions, different read/write schemes can be easily evaluated
at the very early stage of the design.
